<h1>Problems with the DMCA</h1>

<p> Every day, the MAFIAA uses the <a href=/whatisthedmca.html>DMCA</a> to
    take down more “illegal” content, and I for one am sick of this abuse.
    Some of that content was illegally copied, but not all of it. Not most
    of it, even. How much of it was covered by fair use? How much was
    outright censorship? And how long will it be before them come for
    <em>your</em> content?</p>

<p> Here's how the it works: The MAFIAA uses software “bots” to scan the Web
    for anything they don't like. Then, they <a
        href="http://mashable.com/2015/08/09/pixels-dmca/">indiscriminatly</a>
    send takedown notices to everything that even looks at them the wrong way.
    These bots are dead <a
        href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/absurd-automated-notices-illustrate-abuse-dmca-takedown-process">stupid</a>.
    So <a
        href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120527/23520719089/dmca-notices-so-stupid-it-hurts.shtml">stupid</a>
    the MAFIAA has been know to mistakenly take down their <strong>own
        content</strong> on occasion. So <a
        href="https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2010/07/01/dmca-fail-the-5-dumbest-takedown-notices/">stupid</a>
    they'll take down content even if they don't own the rights to anything in
    it.

<p> Part of the idea of the DMCA was that hosts would reject bad noticecs like
    these, but that isn't what happens. Can you blame Google for not reading
    the <a
        href="https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/">millions</a>
    of takedown notices they get <em>every week</em>? 

<p> Sometimes they will even cut deals with hosts to lay off the notices if the
    hosts does their own scanning, by even stricter standards than what the
    DMCA mandates. These “DMCA+” systems are <a
        href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/youtubes-content-id-c-ensorship-problem">deny</a>
    users even the limited rights they have under standard copyright law. <p>

<p> The most disturbing incidents, though, are the ones that
    <strong>aren't</strong> automated. Because no one reads these notices, the
    MAFIAA can use them as precision tactical censorship missiles. Even smaller
    buisnesses are getting in on the action. See how a game studio tried to <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6s0Wpn1zmU">take down</a> (mentioned at 5:50 in that video)
    negative reviews of their terrible game.</p>

<p> To fix this problem, we must punish rightsholders when they abuse the
    system by sending millions of notices. In some countries, it's <a
        href="https://torrentfreak.com/should-websites-charge-a-fee-to-process-copyright-takedowns-120528/">legal</a>
    to charge fees for processing takedown notices. This does raise the valid
    point that this is equivalent to paying sites for hosting infringing
    content. This is a legitiamate problem, but one that many countries
    "solved" by having the fees sent to the host's ISP. This practice is
    ridiculous. The ISP should be no more responsible for the host's content
    than their electric company. (By extension, ISP's should not be required to
    censor copyrighted content, as I've seen them do in the UK). </p>

<p> Instead, we should allow fees to be charged only for blatantly false
    notices, such as some of the ones mentioned in the links above. This will
    cause rightsholders to stop using robots to send notices (or at lest, to
    make their robots a little less stupid), and hosts for read the notices
    they recieve. If Google could make $30 for spending 15 minutes to read a
    notice, you can bet they'd look at every last one! I don't think this will
    be a problem in courts—it's obvious when a company takes down a site that
    has nothing to do with their content. </p>
