        <p>Are you sure the file is named <tt>lab3_name_section</tt>? Unix file
            systems are case-sensitive, so if it's really
            <tt>Lab3_name_section</tt>, that's a different file. A good way to
            know the command will work is to only type the first part then
            tab-complete it. Pressing TAB will make the shell look for commands
            or files that you might want to use and fill in their names for you.
            Saves a lot of typing.</p>

        <p>There's another possibility: the shell will only look up commands in
            the directories indicated by the <code>$PATH</code> environment
            variable. On Unix, the current directory is almost never in the
            PATH. (I heard somewhere that this is for security reasons.) (NOTE:
            Zeus is one of the "almost never" systems.) If you want to run a
            command in the current directory, use a path to it:</p>

        <pre>./lab3_name_section &lt; sample_input.txt</pre>
        <p>See the <tt>./</tt> there? <tt>.</tt> refers to the current
            directory.</p>

        <p>If you want to be fancy / need to run it over and over again, you can
            put this in your Makefile:</p>
<pre>.PHONY: run
run: lab3_name_section
	./$&lt;
</pre>

            <p>Then just <code>make run</code>, and make will build and run your
                program all at once.</p>
