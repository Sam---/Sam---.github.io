    <h1>My Opinion on Monopoly</h1>
    <p>Monopoly is a pretty good game. It's not the best game ever made, but
      it's certainly not the hours-long slog that most people play. It's a
      ruthless game of carefully tricking your opponents into giving you what
      you want while thinking they're getting a good deal, then either
      watching them fall apart one by one, or desperately trying to hold your
      game together even as the vultures circle and pick out their share of the
      meat.</p>
    <p>It was based on a game made by <i>who?</i> in <i>year?</i> designed to
      teach its players about the evils of capitalism. In her game, you would
      first play in a ruthless zero-sum winner-takes-all mode reminiscent of
      early American business (Need workers with small hands? Hire children!),
      then the rules would change to those of a socialist ideal, and the
      players could witness the result first-hand.</p>

    <p>Sadly, the sheet of rules included in every game never seems to
      get read. Instead, people modify the rules in numerous and often
      counterproductive ways, partly out of ignorance, partly out of a
      misguided need to make the game simpler. Here, I list a few of them, and
      their effect on the game.</p>
    <h2>No Trades</h2>
    <p>Without trades, you lose a whole dimension of gameplay. Why people
      would want to consign themselves to the hours long dice-rolling
      exercise that is Monopoly without trades is beyond me. In several
      cases, people were surprised when I told them trading was legal in
      Monopoly. Even after I showed them the section in the rules where
      trading is defined, they remained somewhat incredulous. Then, they
      take a bunch of bad deals because they didn't negotiate and began to
      boycott trades under the belief that they would inevitably be a bad
      deal.</p>
    <p>Sometimes trades are a bad deal, but often two players can make a
      mutually beneficial trade, especially is one of the players is
      desperate. Note that the printed value of a property dose not
      necessarily correspond to the value of that property. In some cases,
      paying $500 for a $200 property is a good move. Similarly, selling
      Boardwalk ($400) for $300 or $250 can help out if you really <i>need
        cash now</i>.</p>
    <p>Basically, they're the bread and butter of Monopoly. Leaving them
      out makes no sense.</p>
    <h2>No Auctions</h2>
    <p>
      When a player lands on property but can't pay for it, what happens?
      Answer: Players, including the one short on funds, bid on it until
      one of them makes a bid that no other player will match. This might
      be lower than the printed price, or much higher.</p>
    <p>It's common for Monopoly to be played without auctions, but their
      complexity is not without cause. They provide another way for money
      to leave player hands, shortening the game (less money
      <code>==</code> faster bankruptcy), and serve to distribute
      properties faster, which also shortens the game. In many cases, they
      can result in interesting strategies: One time, I bid on a property
      in the hope that another player would match my bid, only to then
      win the property at a price much higher that what it was worth. This
      worked, but I still lost the game.</p>
    <p>I think most people play without auctions simply because they don't
      know they exist. Read the rules!</p>
    <h2>Money on Free Parking</h2>
    <p>The Taxes were intended to drain money from the game. PLacing their
      proceeds on Free Parking removes this essential drain and makes the
      game longer (see above).</p>
    <p>People will sometimes justify this as money paid back into the
      community from taxes, but this card already takes care of that:</p>

    <p>The rest was spent in Afghanistan. 'Murica!</p>
    <h2>You need to land on a property to build on it.</h2>
    <p>In Monopoly, you can build on a property <a>at any time</a>.</p>
    <p>One of the nastier house rules, since it extends the late game out
      into infinity by guaranteeing that almost no houses will ever be
      built. Without houses, rent is like a (non-malaria/West Nile)
      mosquito. Annoying, but not life-threatening. These mosquito rent
      rates can't make enough of an impact of a player's budget to bankrupt
      them. This not only prolongs the game, but also lowers its stakes.</p>
    <h2>You can only build on your turn.</h2>
    <p>In Monopoly, you can build on a property <a><b>at any time</b></a>.
    </p>
    <p>There's no reason to restrict construction to only your turn.</p>
    <h2>You can't build houses/hotels between the time a player moves their
      piece and the time they land on your property.</h2>
    <p>Alice rolls her dice. She gets a 10. Eve can tell Alice is about to
      land on one of her properties, so she quickly lays a spread of houses
      on the color group. Now Alice is out $1,000 more than she would have
      been.</p>
    <p>It's pretty crazy to think this is OK, but this is a valid
      interpretation of the rules. It's almost certainly not intended,
      though, so this rule is perfectly OK. Whether Alice can actually
      carry out the exploit depends mostly on the other players. I tried
      this once, and the result was a full-blown proletariat
      revolution.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Why do people play Monopoly this way? I think part of it is that the
      new generation (including me!) learned it when they were too young to
      really understand the game. Part of the problem is that the game
      advertises itself as being for children. No child I ever met had the
      attention span to get through more than half an hour of the game, with
      made-up rules or not. Compounding the problem, most of them aren't
      capable of the critical thinking necessary to play it.</p>
    <p>News flash to parents: Your kid is not a genius. In fact, your kid is
      probably pretty stupid. Hell, I was pretty stupid when I was ten. It's
      not their fault. Their brains haven't finished growing yet. Just keep
      them off the sugar and McDonald's and they'll turn out just fine.
      Anecdote: I went to an awful elementary school. The standard for
      excellence was, "If you're not screaming or throwing things then who
      cares if you're learning." But I turned out fine. In fact, I'm a
      <span class=swear>fuck</span>ing genius<span class=citationneeded>
        [<a href=/citation_needed.html>citation needed</a>]</span>.</p>
    <p>The other problem is that those children (i.e. me) grew up thinking
      they knew how to play Monopoly, and never tried to learn for ourselves.
      That's not ideal. I think the only reason some people still try to play
      it is because they were kids when they first picked up the game. When
      you're a kid, everything is fun. You can tell by playing and game,
      especially video games, made for children. If the game doesn't suck ass,
      then it was probably made with adults in mind.</P>
    <p>(<a href=excred>Extra
        Credits did a video on the dysfunction that is kids games</a>, you
      might want to check
      that out.)</p>
    <p>All this is pretty sad, because now I can't really play Monopoly.
      Playing a game with a bunch of players who are essentially learning it
      anew is only rarely fun, especially if they don't take the game
      seriously. Maybe someday I'll find a group of people who also know how
      to play, but that will require handling <a href=/tbc.html>some problems
        I have</a>. Until then, I'll just have to find other games.</p>
